PROJECT TITLE: Assassin's Creed Resurrection
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: OOP Mini Project
VERSION or DATE: 1
AUTHORS: Idan Goldstein

Story ( to be added to the game):

30km outside Bucharest, Romania. The year is 2076.
Two groups fight in the shadows, a fight that seems to have no end, a fight that has been going on for centuries.
The Assassin Brotherhood have a sole purpose, to preserve the Isu's legacy and their technology.
Abstergo, a multinational company aims to put their hands on this technology, as it would grant them eternal knowledge and power.

Over the years that Assassins fought hard yet over the last century their numbers are decreasing. Abstergo has already gained quite a few artifacts, some of which they already use nowadays 
to command their workers to work non-stop. 

They must be stopped. 

The Romanian Assassins and head of the local brotherhood, Vlad, was sent to a mission a few weeks ago to inspect strange signals coming from an Abstergo server farm. He hasn't created contact since. 

You are tasked to go there and find out what happened to him.

This mission might be the final mission of this brotherhood, as without Vlad there is no one left to lead this brotherhood.

YOU MUST FIND HIM. GOOD LUCK.
